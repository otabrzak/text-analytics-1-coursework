       " 'To address the challenges in the implementation of machine learning, ADAGOS has developed NeurEco. A new neural network approach based on parsimony. NeurEco reduces the resources (size of learning data, energy consumption, size of neural network and memory requirement, computing time, development time) required to implement machine learning methods by several orders of magnitude when compared with the current state of the art. Their first significant fields of application are embedded systems and the Internet of Things. By achieving the smallest sufficient network structure, they minimize the network’s battery consumption and make it possible to embed AI on small devices and to increase their autonomy. Thanks to its parsimony, NeurEco requires less data for learning. It is even possible to embed the learning process and to update the neural network on the fly, avoiding the need for waiting weeks and months to collect enough data. Their second major field of application is healthcare. Thanks to parsimony, any prediction given by ADAGOS’s neural networks comes with a clear explanation.',\n",

       " 'THE VISION VoltAero is taking electric aircraft to an entirely new level. Benefitting from 10 years of pioneering expertise, VoltAero is developing a truly unique general aviation airplane with a distributed hybrid-electric propulsion system for safe, quiet, efficient and eco-friendly flight. The VoltAero aircraft utilizes a combination of electric motors and an internal combustion engine in a “push-pull” configuration. A flight demonstrator, along with a ground-based “iron bird” system test rig, will validate VoltAero’s hybrid configuration through late 2019, de-risking it for airworthiness certification and the subsequent application on a new-production airplane to be built using strong, lightweight composite materials. Seating from four to nine persons, VoltAero’s production aircraft will have a flight duration of at least 3.5 hours – providing a highly-capable and reliable general aviation platform for private owners, air taxi/charter companies, commercial flights for point-to-point regional travel, and for use in other utility-category applications. Deliveries of production aircraft are expected to begin during the 2021-2022 timeframe from VoltAero’s final assembly facility in the Nouvelle Aquitaine region of southwest France.

Since 2015, Elixir Aircraft has pursued a simple objective: to offer more versatile, safer, greener and more economical aircraft, by providing relevant, modern and innovative answers to the recurring problems encountered by light aviation. Elixir Aircraft is born from a basic observation: complexity is the main source of failures (technical or human) in today's aviation. Exacerbated by an aging aircraft fleet, this complexity is also very expensive in terms of operating cost (fuel & maintenance). To respond to this, Elixir Aircraft has introduced the OneShot carbon process in the design of its aircraft, a technology derived from competitive sailing, allowing it to greatly simplify the structure. More simplicity means fewer areas of failure, therefore safer, this allows for a significant reduction in operating costs (40$/h estimated in fuel and maintenance). In continuous growth since its creation, Elixir Aircraft now employs more than 80 employees, on 2 sites in La Rochelle, France.\",\n",

EA4T sells Web APIs and/or embedded services (subscriptions or licenses), enabling new communication interfaces based on natural language (written or spoken), operating in a multimodal way, available on any kind of device, whether or not it is connected to the Internet. Each company, each organization who needs modern communications between a person and a digital system, will have to rethink the interaction models. Voice and speech will gradually replace traditional interfaces (keyboard, mouse, touch) to offer communication interfaces based on natural language. Speech is the most natural and effective way of communication that man uses to exchange and transfer ideas and informations. With the advent of mobile devices, Automatic Speech Processing (ASR) and Natural Language (NLP/NLU/NLA) technologies will experience considerable growth and gradually replace traditional human/machine interfaces. Any organization wishing to significantly increase the quality and reliability of these new digital interactions must consider voice-based request interfaces who are able to : - Understand what you are saying, regardless of the surrounding conditions - Formulate precise and concise answers in natural language, taking into account the context This is EA4T's mission Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator\",\n",

Cluster analysis of crime data based on the recursive Bayesian mixture estimation algorithm is used to identify crime hotspots and estimate local models of crime type. The experiments report that the 2D configuration of the algorithm allows the detection of crime hotspots online. The 3D configuration provides 29% more accurate crime type models than 2D clustering and alternative data mining algorithms. For the data set used, it was determined in which crime hotspots the most serious and most frequent types of crime can be expected to occur with the highest probability. The limitation of the study is the artificial support of the 3D clusters by the fully continuous data vector with the recoded values of the crime type. The potential use of the algorithm is expected in online web applications for sharing information on criminal offenses managed by the Police of the Czech Republic with the public and local government entities in the Czech Republic.n",crime location;crime type;cluster analysis;recursive Bayesian mixture estimation

The recognition algorithms should work regardless of a particular orientation of the object in the space. In this paper, we introduce new 3D rotation moment invariants, which are composed of non-separable Appell moments. We show that non-separable moments may outperform the separable ones in terms of recognition power and robustness thanks to a better distribution of their zero surfaces over the image space. We test the numerical properties and discrimination power of the proposed invariants on three real datasets—MRI images of human brain, 3D scans of statues, and confocal microscope images of worms. We show the robustness to resampling errors improved more than twice and the recognition rate increased by 2–10 % comparing to most common descriptors. In the last section, we show how these invariants can be used in state-of-the-art neural networks for image recognition. The proposed H-NeXtA architecture improved the recognition rate by 2–5 % over the current networks.",3D rotation invariants;Non-separable moments;Appell polynomials;Convolutional neural networks

This paper adopts a novel framework that combines a multivariate Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and Copula modeling in a two-stage approach to analyze the cryptocurrency volatility dynamics. By combining the aforementioned techniques, on top of showing that price movements in one cryptocurrency can significantly influence others, the use of copulas highlight how these effects can vary across different parts of distributions and thus for different types of events with respect to their extreme nature. The interconnectedness complexity should be taken into consideration when managing risk in portfolio and constructing relevant models.",Bitcoin;Computer modeling;Simulation;Price dynamics

This optimization problem is known to be non-convex and thus difficult to solve. A well-known solution methodology consists in reformulating the objective function and the constraints of the original problem in terms of positive semi-definite matrix traces, to which we add a rank constraint. To convexify the problem, we remove this rank constraint. Our main focus is to provide a strong mathematical proof of the exactness of this convex relaxation technique. To this end, we explore the geometry of the feasible set of the problem via its Pareto-front. We prove that the feasible set of the original problem and the feasible set of its convexification share the same Pareto-front. From a numerical point of view, this exactness result allows to reduce the initial problem to a semi-definite program, which can be solved by more efficient algorithms.",Electric power distribution network;Optimal power flow;Convex relaxation;Pareto-front

FPD obtains the optimal strategy for decision tasks using only probability distributions, which is its main asset. The standard way of solving decision tasks is provided by Markov decision processes (MDP), which FPD covers as a special case. Methods of solving discounted MDPs have already been introduced. However, the use of FPD might be advantageous when solving tasks with an unknown system model. Due to its probabilistic nature, FPD is able to obtain a more precise estimation of this model. After previously introducing discounting and system model estimation to FPD, the current work examines the effect of discounting on decision processes and its possible advantages when dealing with an unknown system model.",Bayesian estimation;decision making;discounting;forgetting;probabilistic strategy design;supression of aproximate modelling impact

We state an upper bound for the nested distance between the exact process and its approximation and discuss its convergence in the one-dimensional case. We further propose an adjustment of the approximation, which guarantees that the approximate problem is bounded.

Rigid plastic and elastoplastic regimes are considered. In particular, we show that limit deformations can essentially freely bend even if subjected to the most restrictive constraints corresponding to the elastically rigid single-slip regime. The primary challenge arises in the upper bound where the differential constraints render any bending without incurring an additional energy cost particularly difficult. We overcome this obstacle with suitable non-smooth constructions and prove that a Lavrentiev phenomenon occurs if wenartificially restrict our model to smooth deformations.

Deep image prior (DIP) promises to model a naturally looking image due to a well-chosen structure of a neural network. The use of DIP in BID results in a significant perfor-mance improvement in terms of average PSNR. In this contribution, we offer qualitative analysis of selected DIP-based methods w.r.t. two types of undesired solutions: blurred image (no-blur) and a visually corrupted image (solution with artifacts). We perform a sensitivity study showing which aspects of the DIP-based algorithms help to avoid which undesired mode. We confirm that the no-blur can be avoided using either sharp image prior or tuning of the hyperparameters of the optimizer. The artifact solution is a harder problem since variations that suppress the artifacts often suppress good solutions as well. Switching to the structural similarity index measure fro m L 2 norm in loss was found to be the most successful approach to mitigate the artifacts.",Blind Image Deconvolution;Deep Image Prior;No-Blur;Variational Bayes

Such a bipartite scheme can be described by a staircase: the collection of its minimal points. The complexity of a scheme is the maximal share size relative to the secret size, and the kappa-complexity of an access structure is the best lower bound provided by the entropy method. An access structure is kappa-ideal if it has kappa-complexity 1. Motivated by the abundance of open problems in this area, the main results can be summarized as follows. First, a new characterization of kappa-ideal multipartite access structures is given which offers a straightforward and simple approach to describe ideal bipartite and tripartite access structures. Second, the kappa-complexity is determined for a range of bipartite access structures, including those determined by two points, staircases with equal widths and heights, and staircases with all heights 1. Third, matching linear schemes are presented for some non-ideal cases, including staircases where all heights are 1 and all widths are equal. Finally, finding the Shannon complexity of a bipartite access structure can be considered as a discrete submodular optimization problem.

However, the use of 2nd generation models requires higher frequency with which the dynamic images are acquired (around 1.5 s per image). Blind deconvolution can decrease the demands on temporal resolution as shown previously for one of the 1st generation models. Here, the temporal-resolution requirements achievable for blind deconvolution with a 2nd generation model are studied. Methods: The 2nd generation model is formulated as the distributed-capillary adiabatic-tissue-homogeneity (DCATH) model. Blind deconvolution is based on Parker's model of the arterial input function. The accuracy and precision of the estimated arterial input functions and the perfusion parameters is evaluated on synthetic and real clinical datasets with different levels of the temporal resolution. Results: The estimated arterial input functions remained unchanged from their reference high-temporalresolution estimates (obtained with the sampling interval around 1 s) when increasing the sampling interval up to about 5 s for synthetic data and up to 3.6-4.8 s for real data. Further increasing of the sampling intervals led to systematic distortions, such as lowering and broadening of the 1st pass peak. The resulting perfusionparameter estimation error was below 10% for the sampling intervals up to 3 s (synthetic data), in line with the real data perfusion-parameter boxplots which remained unchanged up to the sampling interval 3.6 s. Conclusion: We show that use of blind deconvolution decreases the demands on temporal resolution in DCE-MRI from about 1.5 s (in case of measured arterial input functions) to 3-4 s. This can be exploited in increased spatial resolution or larger organ coverage.",DCE-MRI;Blind deconvolution;2nd generation pharmacokinetic model;Temporal resolution

Experimental investigations of the mechanical response of NiTi polycrystalline samples within a broad stress-strain-temperature state space have revealed a complex response involving martensitic transformation, reorientation, and plastic deformation processes. The interactions between them result in complex coupled phenomena, such as transformation-induced plasticity, martensite stabilization through plastic deformation, and micro-strain heterogeneity induced by plasticity. Plastic deformation in NiTi not only generates irrecoverable strain at the macroscale, but it also induces substantial strain heterogeneity in the microstructure.

The class of all convex weak concordance measures also contains, for example, Spearman's footrule ϕ, which is not a concordance measure. In this paper, we first introduce basic convex weak concordance measures built in general by means of a single point (u,v)∈▽={(u,v)∈]0,1[2|u≥v} and its transpose (v,u) only. Then, based on basic convex weak concordance measures and probability measures on the Borel subsets of ▽, two rather general constructions of convex weak concordance measures are proposed, discussed and exemplified. Inspired by Edwards et al., probability measures-based constructions are generalized to Borel measures on B(]0,1[2)-based constructions also allowing some infinite measures to be considered.

This means that any MDP task can be approximated by an explicitly found FPD task whereas many FPD tasks have no MDP equivalent. MDP and FPD model the closed loop — the coupling of an agent and its environment — via a joint probability density (pd) relating the involved random variables, referred to as behaviour. Unlike MDP, FPD quantifies agent’s aims and constraints by an ideal pd. The ideal pd is high on the desired behaviours, small on undesired behaviours and zero on forbidden ones. FPD selects the optimal decision rules as the minimiser of Kullback-Leibler’s divergence of the closed-loop-modelling pd to its ideal twin. The proximity measure choice follows from the FPD axiomatics. MDP minimises the expected total loss, which is usually the sum of discounted partial losses. The discounting reflects the decreasing importance of future losses. It also diminishes the influence of errors caused by:n▶ the imperfection of the employed environment model.n▶ roughly-expressed aims.n▶ the approximate learning and decision-rules design.nThe established FPD cannot currently account for these important features. The paper elaborates the missing discounted version of FPD. This non-trivial filling of the gap in FPD also employs an extension of dynamic programming, which is of an independent interest.",Design principles;Kullback-Leibler's divergence;Probabilistic techniques;Discounting;Closed loop

The variables in the second layer depend on the variables in the first layer. The dependence is characterized by conditional probability tables, which represent Noisy-AND models. We refer to this class of models as BN2A models. We found that these models are also popular in the psychometric community, where they can be found under the name of Cognitive Diagnostic Models (CDMs), which are used to classify test takers into some latent classes according to the similarity of their responses to test questions. This paper shows the relation between some BN2A models and their corresponding CDMs. In particular, we compare the performance of these models on large-scale tests conducted in the Czech Republic in 2022.

This background is caused by nuclear power plants, nuclear research reactors, and medical isotope production facilities and contributes to samples collected by the noble gas systems of the International Monitoring Stations (IMS). Because of that background, standard linear inverse model applied to Xe-133 measurements is prone to substantial errors. To address this problem, we investigate possible methods for separation of the background signal and any signal from a nuclear explosion, which is further processed for estimation of the Xe-133 source term. We assume that the observed unknown point release of Xe-133 can be modeled as a linear model y=Mx, where y is the vector of observations, M is source-receptor sensitivity (SRS) matrix,nand x is the temporal profile of the unknown release from a nuclear explosion, i.e. its source term. Since the signal in the observation vector is most probably mixed with civilian emitters, we test methods for separation of the contributions from the unknown signal and the background. We compare various approaches, ranging from simple model calibration, to simulated background term and their combinations with anomaly detection.

An autofocusing criterion is then formulated using the central moments, and the fast acquisition of the focal point is achieved by searching for the position that minimizes the criterion. Theoretical analysis and experimental validation of the method are performed and the results show that the method can achieve fast and accurate autofocusing. The proposed method requires only three single-pixel detections for each focusing position of the target object to evaluate the focusing criterion without imaging the target object. The method does not require any active object-to-camera distance measurement.

Moreover, the only residual nonlinearity vanishes on the 4-dimensional linear subspace being forward invariant when 2 of 3 virtual inputs are set to be zero. Dynamics inside that subsystem is actually the chain of 4 integrators fed by the remaining single virtual input and it can be interpreted as a rich variety of synchronous movements of torsos and legs. In such a way, the seemingly abstract and purely theoretical result can be used to design the walking-like movement during the single-support phase. The impact effect during the impulsive-like double-support phase is then attenuated by further special trajectories tuning and finite-time stabilization technique which provides the sustainable multi-step walking design. Moreover, the target walking-like trajectory is attracted by nearby trajectories. This further justify the importance and usefulness of the mentioned state and feedback equivalence. Its viability is further demonstrated by the simulations of various scenarios of the walking-like movement and the respective torsos behaviors.",Chained mechanical systems walking;State and feedback equivalence

Our findings indicate that crypto connectedness reflects important events and oscillates substantially while reaching lower limit values when compared to traditional financial markets. Periods of extremely high or low connectedness are clearly linked to specific events in the crypto market and macroeconomic or monetary history. Furthermore, existing asymmetry from good and bad volatility indicates that market downturns spill over substantially faster than comparable market surges. Overall, the connectedness dynamics are driven by a combination of both crypto (momentum, on-chain activity, off-chain activity) and legacy financial and economic (financial and economic uncertainty, and financial market performance) factors, while the asymmetry is more connected to the off-chain crypto activity and the combination of economic, financial, and monetary factors.

However, a deeper inspection of the dynamics reveals that such a trade-off is mostly valid for the most illiquid cryptocurrencies, which are susceptible to microstructure noise.",Microstructure noise;Idiosyncratic volatility;Expected returns;Bitcoin;Cryptocurrencies

Here, we used a data-driven approach to characterizing the perceived appearance characteristics of 30 samples of wood veneer using a „visual fingerprint“ that describes each sample as a multidimensional feature vector, with each dimension capturing a different aspect of the appearance. Fifty-six crowd-sourced participants viewed triplets of movies depicting different wood samples as the sample rotated.

The essence of the approach can be outlined as follows: the output is redesigned first so that the agents attain the minimum-phase property. The second step is to apply the exact feedback linearization to the agents. This transformation divides their dynamics into a linear observable part and a non-observable part. It is shown that consensus of the linearizable parts of the agents implies consensus of the entire multi-agent system. To achieve the consensus of the original system, the inverse transformation of the exact feedback linearization is applied. However, its application causes changes in the dynamics of the multi-agent system. a way to mitigate this effect is proposed. Two examples are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed synchronization algorithm.

None of the many software tools for K-trans quantification are standardized. The ISMRM Open Science Initiative for Perfusion Imaging-Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced (OSIPI-DCE) challenge was designed to benchmark methods to better help the efforts to standardize K-trans measurement. Methods: A framework was created to evaluate K-trans values produced by DCE-MRI analysis pipelines to enable benchmarking. The perfusion MRI community was invited to apply their pipelines for K-trans quantification in glioblastoma from clinical and synthetic patients. Submissions were required to include the entrants' K-trans values, the applied software, and a standard operating procedure. These were evaluated using the proposed OSIPIgold score defined with accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility components. Results: Across the 10 received submissions, the OSIPIgold score ranged from 28% to 78% with a 59% median. The accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility scores ranged from 0.54 to 0.92, 0.64 to 0.86, and 0.65 to 1.00, respectively (0-1 = lowest-highest). Manual arterial input function selection markedly affected the reproducibility and showed greater variability in K-trans analysis than automated methods. Furthermore, provision of a detailed standard operating procedure was critical for higher reproducibility. Conclusions: This study reports results from the OSIPI-DCE challenge and highlights the high inter-software variability within K-trans estimation, providing a framework for ongoing benchmarking against the scores presented. Through this challenge, the participating teams were ranked based on the performance of their software tools in the particular setting of this challenge. In a real-world clinical setting, many of these tools may perform differently with different benchmarking methodology.",challenge;data analysis;DCE-MRI;glioblastoma;open-science;perfusion

J.;Ortigosa, R.;Kružík, Martin","The use of Electro-Active Polymers (EAPs) for the fabrication of evermore sophisticated miniaturised soft robotic actuators has seen an impressive development in recent years. The incorporation of crystallographic anisotropic micro-architectures, within an otherwise nearly uniform isotropic soft polymer matrix, has shown great potential in terms of advanced three-dimensional actuation (i.e. stretching, bending, twisting), especially at large strains, that is, beyond the onset of geometrical pull-in instabilities. From the computational point of view, the design of accurate and robust albeit efficient constitutive models is a very active area of research. This paper introduces a novel polyconvex phenomenological invariant-based transversely isotropic formulation (and relevant computational frameworks) for the simulation of transversely isotropic EAPs at large strains, where the ab initio satisfaction of polyconvexity is exploited to ensure the robustness of numerical results for any range of deformations and applied electric fields. The paper also presents key important results both in terms of the existence of minimisers and material stability of coupled electro-mechanics, enhancing previous works in the area of large strain elasticity. In addition, a comprehensive series of selected numerical examples is included in order to demonstrate the effect that the anisotropic orientation and the contrast of material properties, as well as the level of deformation and electric field, have upon the response of the EAP when subjected to large three-dimensional stretching, bending and torsion, including the possible development of wrinkling and the potential loss of ellipticity in ill-posed constitutive models.",Polyconvexity;Transversely isotropic;Finite element method;Dielectric elastomers;Electro-elasticity

H.;Suk, Tomáš;Alsabah, M.;Hussain, A.","Discrete Racah polynomials (DRPs) are highly efficient orthogonal polynomials widely used in various scientific fields for signal representation. They find applications in disciplines like image processing and computer vision. Racah polynomials were originally introduced by Wilson and later modified by Zhu to be orthogonal on a discrete set of samples. However, when the degree of the polynomial is high, it encounters numerical instability issues. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called Improved Stabilization (ImSt) for computing DRP coefficients. The algorithm partitions the DRP plane into asymmetric parts based on the polynomial size and DRP parameters. We have optimized the use of stabilizing conditions in these partitions. To compute the initial values, we employ the logarithmic gamma function along with a new formula. This combination enables us to compute the initial values efficiently for a wide range of DRP parameter values and large polynomial sizes. Additionally, we have derived a symmetry relation for the case when the Racah polynomial parameters are zero ($a=0$, $alpha=0$, $beta=0$). This symmetry makes the Racah polynomials symmetric, and we present a different algorithm for this specific scenario. We have demonstrated that the ImSt algorithm works for a broader range of parameters and higher degrees compared to existing algorithms. A comprehensive comparison between ImSt and the existing algorithms has been conducted, considering the maximum polynomial degree, computation time, restriction error analysis, and reconstruction error. The results of the comparison indicate that ImSt outperforms the existing algorithms for various values of Racah polynomial parameters.",Racah polynomials;Recurrence formulas;Stabilizing condition;Improved stabilization;Orthogonal moments

The novelty consists in consideration of asymmetric dynamics and non-equal static gains of the identified system. A different system behavior after changing the input variable polarity near the operating point is rarely considered or even omitted within relay-based parameter identification tests, in contrast to the common use of asymmetry in the nonlinear relay element. The thing is that many existing relay-based identification techniques in the frequency domain use integrations, assuming that the system output operating point coincides with the setpoint value (i.e., the offset between them is zero). However, this is not true for asymmetric dynamic systems, which yields considerably erroneous parameter estimation as the integration result is highly sensitive to the baseline value. The resulting iterative numerical optimization-based algorithm is built-up using a chain of natural assumptions and step-by-step thought experiments. The proposed framework is applied to the well-established exponential decaying method in this paper. Some computation aspects of the algorithm are discussed. A comparative numerical study illustrates the efficacy of the proposed strategy, where several frequency-fitting-based and descriptive-function-based competitive approaches are considered.",Asymmetric dynamics;system identification;system dynamics;frequency-domain analysis;relay feedback;parameter estimation;optimization

The best simplified measurable material texture representation and approximation of this general surface reflectance function is the seven-dimensional Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF). BTF can be simultaneously measured and modeled using state-of-the-art measurement devices and computers and the most advanced mathematical models of visual data. However, such an enormous amount of visual BTF data, measured on the single material sample, inevitably requires state-of-the-art storage, compression, modeling, visualization, and quality verification. Storage technology is still the weak part of computer technology, which lags behind recent data sensing technologies, thus, even for virtual reality correct materials modeling, it is infeasible to use BTF measurements directly. Hence, for visual texture synthesis or analysis applications, efficient mathematical BTF models cannot be avoided. The probabilistic  BTF models allow unlimited seamless material texture enlargement, texture restoration, tremendous unbeatable appearance data compression (up to 1:1000 000), and even editing or creating new material appearance data. Simultaneously, they require neither storing actual measurements nor any pixel-wise parametric representation. Unfortunately, there is no single universal BTF model applicable for physically correct modeling of visual properties  of all possible BTF textures. Every presented model is better suited for some subspace of possible BTF textures, either natural or artificial. In this contribution, we intend to survey existing mathematical BTF models which allow physically correct modeling and enlargement measured texture under any illumination and viewing conditions while simultaneously offer huge compression ratio relative to natural surface materials optical measurements. Exceptional 3D Markovian or mixture models, which can be either solved analytically or iteratively and quickly synthesized, are presented. Illumination invariants can be derived from some of its recursive statistics and exploited in content-based image retrieval, supervised or unsupervised image recognition. Although our primary goal is physically correct texture synthesis of any unlimited size, the presented models are equally helpful for various texture analytical applications. Their modeling efficiency is demonstrated in several analytical and modeling image applications, in particular, on a (un)supervised image segmentation, bidirectional texture function (BTF) synthesis and compression, and adaptive multi-spectral and multi-channel image and video restoration.",Bidirectional Texture Function;Texture modeling;Markov random fields;Discrete distribution mixtures;EM algorithm

To facilitate a finer control over the resulting tilings, we extend these programs with tile-based, color-based, packing, and variable-sized periodic constraints. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient heuristic algorithm for the maximum-cover variant based on the shortest path search in directed acyclic graphs and derive simple modifications to provide a 1/2 approximation guarantee for arbitrary tile sets, and a 2/3 guarantee for tile sets with cyclic transducers. Finally, we benchmark the performance of the integer programming formulations and of the heuristic algorithms showing that the heuristics provide very competitive outputs in a fraction of time.

For belief function undirected graphical models, assuming that the set of belief functions in the model is non-informative, the belief functions are distinct. We illustrate this using Haenni-Lehmann's Communication Network problem. As the joint belief function for this model is quasi-consonant, it follows from a property of d-entropy that the d-entropy of this model is zero, and no algorithm is required. For a class of undirected graphical models, we provide an algorithm for computing the d-entropy of such models. Finally, the d-entropy coincides with Shannon's entropy for the probability mass function of a single random variable and for a large multi-dimensional probability distribution expressed as a directed acyclic graph model called a Bayesian network.

In addition, its concentrations are constantly rising due to increasing feeding needs and the large use of fertilization and animal farming. Despite the significance of ammonia, its emissions are associated with large uncertainties, while its atmospheric abundance is difficult to measure. Nowadays, satellite products can effectively measure ammonia with low uncertainty and a global coverage. Here, we use satellite observations of column ammonia in combination with an inversion algorithm to derive ammonia emissions with a high resolution over Europe for the period 2013–2020. Ammonia emissions peak in northern Europe due to agricultural application and livestock management, in western Europe (industrial activity), and over Spain (pig farming). Emissions have decreased by −26 % since 2013 (from 5431 Gg in 2013 to 3994 Gg in 2020), showing that the abatement strategies adopted by the European Union have been very efficient. The slight increase (+4.4 %) in 2015 is also reproduced here and is attributed to some European countries exceeding annual emission targets. Ammonia emissions are low in winter (286 Gg) and peak in summer (563 Gg) and are dominated by the temperature-dependent volatilization of ammonia from the soil. The largest emission decreases were observed in central and eastern Europe (−38 %) and in western Europe (−37 %), while smaller decreases were recorded in northern (−17 %) and southern Europe (−7.6 %). When complemented with ground observations, modelled concentrations using the posterior emissions showed improved statistics, also following the observed seasonal trends. The posterior emissions presented here also agree well with respective estimates reported in the literature and inferred from bottom-up and top-down methodologies. These results indicate that satellite measurements combined with inverse algorithms constitute a robust tool for emission estimates and can infer the evolution of ammonia emissions over large timescales.",ammonia emissions;inverse modelling;remote sensing

Common users are uneducated in the decision-making (DM) theory and present their preferences incompletely. That is why we elicit them from such a user during the DM. The paper works with the DM theory called fully probabilistic design (FPD). FPD models closed DM loop, made by the user and the system, by the joint probability density (pd, real pd). A joint ideal pd quantifies the user’s preferences. It assigns high probability values to preferred closed-loop behaviors and low values to undesired behaviors. The real pd should be kept near the ideal pd. By minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the real and ideal pds, the optimal decision policy is found. The presented algorithmic quantification of preferences provides ambitious but potentially reachable DM aims. It suppresses demands on tuning preference-expressing parameters. The considered ideal pd assigns high probabilities to desired (ideal) sets of states and actions. The parameters of the ideal pd (tuned during the DM via the user’s feedback) are: ▶ relative significance of respective probabilities. ▶ a parameter balancing exploration with exploitation. Their systematic tuning solves meta-DM level task, which observes the agent’s satisfaction expressed humanly by “school-marks”. It opts free parameters to reach the best marks.

Our computer simulations show that assortment alone can lead to the formation of cohesive clusters of individuals with low within-group and large between-group variability even in the absence of a spatial separation or disruptive natural selection. All it takes is a proportionality between the variance of inputs (cultural ‘parents’) and outputs (cultural ‘offspring’). We argue that variability-dependent inheritance cannot be easily accomplished by genes alone, but it may be the norm, not the exception, in the transmission of culture between humans.

Long-term operation is a process that may prolong the serviceability of the power plant by 10, 20 or more years. Nevertheless, crucial components as the reactor pressure vessel or its surrounding must be proved before enabling this process. Fast-neutron radiation can have several effects on the concrete biological shield around a nuclear reactor. It can cause changes in the lattice structure of some rock forming minerals, resulting in an increase in volume of several percent and this may lead to cracks between the hardened cement paste and the coarse aggregate grain. Fast neutron radiation is converted in concrete to thermal neutrons which generate secondary gamma radiation and heat whereas gamma generates heat as well. Heat followed by drying causes additional shrinkage of the hardened cement paste. All these affects can be observed via digital images processing after the images have been subjected to segmentation, pre-processing, registration and normalization of the illumination.

From this position, a study and a deeper analysis of the maturity model used in the public administration of Czechia are provided. Further analysis was undertaken via Bayesian networks to answer the question: How do project management and prioritization affect service level management?

The study of schemes using arbitrary probability spaces and unbounded number of participants allows us to investigate their abstract properties, to connect the topic to other branches of mathematics, and to discover new design paradigms. A scheme is perfect if unqualified subsets have no information on the secret, that is, their total share is independent of the secret. By relaxing this security requirement, three other scheme types are defined. Our first result is that every (infinite) access structure can be realized by a perfect scheme where the recovery functions are non-measurable. The construction is based on a paradoxical pair of independent random variables which determine each other. Restricting the recovery functions to be measurable ones, we give a complete characterization of access structures realizable by each type of the schemes. In addition, either a vector-space or a Hilbert-space based scheme is constructed realizing the access structure.

We have performed experiments using datasets with values missing completely at random having different missingness rates and data sizes. We have analyzed the significance of differences between the algorithm performance levels using the Wilcoxon test. The new approach typically learns additional edges in the case of Belief Noisy-or models. We have analyzed this issue using the Chi-square test of independence between the variables in the true models, this approach reveals that additional edges can be explained by strong dependence in generated data.

One of the vital criteria during the history of nuclear fuel development has been fuel assembly’s mechanical stability. Once present, the fuel assembly bow can lead to safety issues like excessive water gap and power redistribution or even incomplete rod insertion (IRI). The extensive bow can result in assembly handling and loading problems. This is why the fuel assembly’s bow is one of the most often controlled geometrical factors during periodic fuel inspections for VVER when compared e.g. to on-site fuel rod gap measurements or other instrumental measurements performed on-site. Our proposed screening method uses existing video records for fuel inspection. We establish video frames normalization and aggregation for the purposes of bow measurement. The whole process is done by digital image processing algorithms which analyze rotations of video frames, extract angles whose source is the fuel set torsion, and reconstruct torsion schema. This approach provides results comparable to the commonly utilized method. We tested this new approach in real operation on 19 fuel assemblies with different campaign numbers and designs, where the average deviation from other methods was less than 2 % on average. Due to the fact, that the method has not yet been validated during full scale measurements of the fuel inspection, the preliminary results stand for that we recommend this method as a complementary part of standard bow measurement procedures to increase measurement robustness, lower time consumption and preserve or increase accuracy. After completed validation it is expected that the proposed method allows standalone fuel assembly bow measurements.",fuel assembly;assembly quality;assembly bow;image processing

This study uses a multi-agent model to investigate the impact of four types of contact tracing strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19.nMethods:nIn order to analyse individual contact tracing in a reasonably realistic setup, we construct an agent-based model of a small municipality with about 60.000 inhabitants (nodes) and about 2.8 million social contacts (edges) in 30 different layers. Those layers reflect demographic, geographic, sociological and other patterns of the TTWA (Travel-to-work-area) Hodonín in Czechia. Various data sources such as census, land register, transport data or data reflecting the shopping behaviour, were employed to meet this purpose. On this multi-graph structure we run a modified SEIR model of the COVID-19 dynamics. The parameters of the model are calibrated on data from the outbreak in the Czech Republic in the period March to June 2020. The simplest type of contact tracing follows just the family, the second tracing version tracks the family and all the work contacts, the third type finds all contacts with the family, work contacts and friends (leisure activities). The last one is a complete (digital) tracing capable of recalling any and all contacts.nWe evaluate the performance of these contact tracing strategies in four different environments. First, we consider an environment without any contact restrictions (benchmark), second with strict contact restriction (replicating the stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions employed in Czechia in the spring 2020), third environment, where the measures were substantially relaxed, and, finally an environment with weak contact restrictions and superspreader events (replicating the situation in Czechia in the summer 2020).nFindings:nThere are four main findings in our paper. 1. In general, local closures are more effective than any type of tracing. 2. In an environment with strict contact restrictions there are only small differences among the four contact tracing strategies. 3. In an environment with relaxed contact restrictions the effectiveness of the tracing strategies differs substantially. 4. In the presence of superspreader events only complete contact tracing can stop the epidemic.",epidemiological model;agent-based model;non-pharmaceutical interventions

The binded complex enters the cell nucleus and acts on DNA, resulting in enhanced production of an enzyme which metabolizes, among others, co-administered drugs. Pharmacodynamic modeling is traditionally based on a compartmental approach, which simplifies the complex processes in the human body through the definition of a small number of compartments representing organs, tissues, cells, cytoplasm or abstract units. Inside a compartment, the concentrations of all substances are assumed to be distributed homogeneously, i.e. there is no spatial dependence. They lead to a system of ODEs for the time-dependence of the concentrations of the active substances. We will present an extension of a model from the literature for the action of the tuberculose-drug Rifampicin. The extension consists of a first attempt to add spatial resolution for substances that are active in the cytoplasm.

Based on best practice in other fields and recent insights in infectious disease epidemiology, one can maximise forecasts’ predictive performance by combining independent models into an ensemble. Here we report the performance of ensemble predictions of COVID-19 cases and deaths across Europe from March 2021 to March 2022. METHODS: We created the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub, an online open-access platform where modellers upload weekly forecasts for 32 countries with results publicly visualised and evaluated. We created a weekly ensemble forecast from the equally-weighted average across individual models' predictive quantiles. We measured forecast accuracy using a baseline and relative Weighted Interval Score (rWIS). We retrospectively explored ensemble methods, including weighting by past performance. RESULTS: We collected weekly forecasts from 48 models, of which we evaluated 29 models alongside the ensemble model. The ensemble had a consistently strong performance across countries over time, performing better on rWIS than 91% of forecasts for deaths (N=763 predictions from 20 models), and 83% forecasts for cases (N=886 predictions from 23 models). Performance remained stable over a 4-week horizon for death forecasts but declined with longer horizons for cases. Among ensemble methods, the most influential choice came from using a median average instead of the mean, regardless of weighting component models. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support combining independent models into an ensemble forecast to improve epidemiological predictions, and suggest that median averages yield better performance than methods based on means. We highlight that forecast consumers should place more weight on incident death forecasts than case forecasts at horizons greater than two weeks.

We built an agent-based model of interactions among pupils and teachers based on a survey in an elementary school in Prague, Czechia. This model contains 624 schoolchildren and 55 teachers and about 27 thousands social contacts in 10 layers. The layers reflect different types of contacts (classroom, cafeteria, etc.) in the survey.

Antigen testing twice a week or PCR once a week significantly reduces infections even when using tests with a lower sensitivity. The structure of social contacts between pupils and teachers strongly influences the transmission. While the density of contact graphs for older pupils is 1.5 times higher than for younger pupils, the teachers’ network is an order of magnitude denser. Teachers moreover act as bridges between groups of children, responsible for 14–18% of infections in the secondary school compared to 8–11% in the primary school.

The first EKF estimates the voltage, current, and electrical load resistance of the secondary winding using measurements of the primary winding. The model of the transformer used is known as mutual inductance. For a short circuit in the secondary winding, the observer generates a signal indicating a fault. The second EKF is designed for harmonic detection and estimates the amplitude and frequency of the primary winding voltage. This contribution focuses on mathematical methods useful for galvanic decoupled soft sensing and fault detection.

Typically, there exist several alternative versions of common statistical methods for every statistical modeling tasknand the most habitually used (“vanilla”) versions may yield rather misleading results in nonstandard situations. Linear regression is considered here as the most fundamental econometric model. First, the analysis of a world tourism dataset is presented, where the number of international arrivals is modeled for 140 countries of the world as a response of 14 pillars (indicators) of the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index. Heteroscedasticity is clearly recognized in the dataset. However, the Aitken estimator, which would be the standard remedy in such a situation, is revealed here to be very inappropriate. Regression quantiles represent a much more suitable solution here. The second illustration with artificial data reveals standard regression quantiles to be unsuitable for data contaminated by outlying values. Their recently proposed robust version turns out to be much more appropriate. Bothnillustrations reveal that choosing suitable methods represent an important (and often difficult) part of the analysis of economic data.",linear regression;assumptions;non-standard situations;robustness;diagnostics

We refer to these models as Mixed Noisy-OR Bayesian Networks. To learn their structure, we modify the Bayesian Information Criterion used for standard Bayesian networks to reflect the number of parameters of a Noisy-OR model. We prove that the log-likelihood function of a Noisy-OR model has a unique maximum and adapt the EM-learning method for the leaky Noisy-OR model. We propose a structure learning algorithm that learns optimal Mixed Noisy-OR Bayesian Networks. We evaluate the proposed approach on synthetic data, where it performs substantially better than standard Bayesian networks. We perform experiments with Bipartite Noisy-OR Bayesian networks of different complexity to find out when the results of Mixed Noisy-OR Bayesian Networks are significantly better than the results of standard Bayesian networks and when they perform similarly. We also study how different penalties based on the number of model parameters affect the quality of the results. Finally, we apply the suggested approach to a problem from the domain of linguistics. Specifically, we use Mixed Noisy-OR Bayesian Networks to model the spread of loanwords in the South-East Asian Archipelago. We perform numerical experiments in which we compare the prediction ability of standard Bayesian networks with Mixed Noisy-OR Bayesian networks and test different pruning methods to reduce the number of parent sets considered.",Bayesian networks;Learning Bayesian networks;Linguistics;Loanwords

P.;Csirmaz, Laszlo","Finding a provably correct subquadratic synchronization algorithm for many filesystem replicas is one of the main theoretical problems in operational transformation (OT) and conflict-free replicated data types (CRDT) frameworks. Based on the algebraic theory of filesystems, which incorporates non-commutative filesystem commands natively, we developed and built a proof-of-concept implementation of an algorithm suite which synchronizes an arbitrary number of replicas. The result is provably correct, and the synchronized system is created in linear space and time after an initial sorting phase. It works by identifying conflicting command pairs and requesting one of the commands to be removed. The method can be guided to reach any of the theoretically possible synchronized states. The algorithm also allows asynchronous usage. After the client sends a synchronization request, the local replica remains available for further modifications. When the synchronization instructions arrive, they can be merged with the changes made since the synchronization request. The suite also works on filesystems with a directed acyclic graph-based path structure in place of the traditional tree-like arrangement. Consequently, our algorithms apply to filesystems with hard or soft links as long as the links create no loops.",file synchronization;algebraic model;optimistic synchronization;linear complexity

Numerical experiments on real as well as simulated multivariate data with more than two dimensions are presented here.

This paper presents various methods to design the stabilizing feedback for the double inverted pendulum actuated between its links and then performs optimization of the model with respect to masses distributions to minimize the controller torques. First, the open-loop control taking the double pendulum to the upper equilibrium is computed from various positions using the optimization tool FMINCON to minimize the torque energy with respect to the mass distribution parameters. Then the optimized parameters are used to test both the LQ feedback for local approximate linearization and the partial exact feedback linearization based nonlinear controller.

Given that the majority of target sequences are not palindromic, the current model explains the symmetry by an overlap of the nonpalindromic motif present on one of the half-sites of the sequences. Here, we show that the implementation of multicomponent mixture models allows for different interpretations consistent with the existence of both palindromic and nonpalindromic submotifs in the sets of integration site sequences. We further show that the weak palindromic motifs result from freely combined site-specific submotifs restricted to only a few positions proximal to the site of integration. The submotifs are formed by either palindrome-forming nucleotide preference or nucleotide exclusion. Using the mixture models, we also identify HIV-1-favored palindromic sequences in Alu repeats serving as local hotspots for integration.

Extending the recursive Bayesian mixture estimation theory to the Poisson mixtures, the paper uses the mixture pointers to construct the traffic state prediction model. Using the predictive model, the cluster at the target urban location is predicted based on the traffic counts measured in real time at the explanatory urban location.
